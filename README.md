(may not be up all the time)

## Requirements for Use
This project requires Apache Tomcat as a web server to run.
If on Windows: Tomcat is automatically installed when installing XAMPP. Install XAMPP here: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html/ Pick 7.1.11 with PHP 7.1.11 for Windows.
If on Mac: To use Tomcat, you need XAMPP server and MySQL running in the background. Download XAMPP here: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html/ for OS X 7.1.11 with PHP 7.1.11. Download Tomcat separately here: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi/
Unzip the file.

## Instructions
Please feel free to skip to where you feel comfortable.

### Setting up the Server
##### Windows:
Open up XAMPP control maanger and start up XAMPP's Apache Web Server, MySQL Database, and Tomcat Web Server. Open up your favorite web browser and type in: localhost:8080. You should see the Tomcat welcome page.

##### Mac:
Open up XAMPP control manager and start Apache Web Server and MySQL Database. There is an additional step to setting up Tomcat. Open the Terminal and navigate to the apache-tomcat-9.0.1, specifically the bin file. Type in "./startup.sh" and if it works, you will see "Tomcat started" as the last line. Open up your favorite web browser and type in: localhost:8080. You should see the Tomcat welcome page.

### Getting the Github Code
Create a new file in apache-tomcat-9.0.1/webapps/ named "cs157a_sec3_team5".
1. Download the ZIP file. Unzip and place into apache-tomcat-9.0.1/webapps/cs157a_sec3_team5
2. Pull it from command line.
3. Use Github Desktop.

### Setting up the Database
In your web browser, navigate to localhost/phpmyAdmin and create a new database named "cs157a_sec3_team5". Click Import at the top of the page and upload the file "cs157a_schema.sql", located from the Github code. Make sure to have foreign key checks unselected! After this, import "cs157a_data.sql". You now have a complete database of users and courses.

## How the Project Works
Since the project has a prefilled database, the natural flow of the website starts with the Head of Department hiring a lecturer, who will then teach classes within that department, who will have students taking their class and the lecturer can then set their grades.

## Features
